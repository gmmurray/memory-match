## Project Name

Memory Match

## Description

A simple memory matching game, similar to the card based games we all played as children. Players are timed as they attempt to find pairs of images and match them together as quickly and efficiently as possible. The game will keep track of a player's best records ad inform them when they beat them.

## Live Link

The app can be access via my website at [this url](https://gregmurray.org/memory-match)

## Technologies Used

This app was built using React and Mini.css for styling.

## Setup

To run this app locally:

1. Download / clone this repo
2. Install package dependencies using `yarn`
3. Start the app using `yarn start`
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Approach

I wanted to create a simple game using just React by just focusing on each feature I wanted without spending too much time getting things to be perfect. I'd like to do a refactor of much of the code so it meets my usual standards, but in the mean time I just wanted to get it working.

## Status

Completed (could use some refactoring)
